        <h1>FYP</h1>
        <p>My final year project focused on evaluating the performance of Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems <strong>(DEWATS)</strong> as a sustainable 
            solution for fecal sludge treatment. This project involved analyzing the effectiveness of DEWATS in removing pollutants, assessing 
            their operational and removal efficiency, and evaluating their sustainability aspects in terms of resource consumption and environmental impact. 
            This experience provided me with in-depth knowledge of fecal sludge management challenges in low middle income countries like Pakistan
            and potential solutions like DEWATS and focus on solutions for sustainable water management practices.</p>

        <h1> Designed surface water treatment plant as Complex Engineering Problem</h1>
        <p> During my "Water Treatment and Design" course, we were tasked with a significant project of designing a wastewater treatment 
            plant. I crafted a thorough design for a Wastewater Treatment Plant <strong>(WWTP)</strong>. This involved careful consideration of 
            critical factors such as flow rate, pollutant load, and treatment efficiency. By basing our calculations on these factors, 
            the resulting design ensured that the plant would meet regulatory standards and effectively purify wastewater for 
            safe discharge or reuse.
