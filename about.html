   <div class="about"><p>I am an <strong>Environmental Engineer</strong> with a strong foundation in sustainability and water treatment, having pursued 
        my studies at <a href="http://nust.edu.pk">NUST University Islamabad.</a> NUST is ranked <strong>#1 in Pakistan</strong> in Science & Technology. It is 
        ranked <strong> #367 in QS World University Rankings 2024.</strong> Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a profound understanding of environmental 
        challenges and solutions, with a particular focus on innovative approaches to water treatment. My commitment to sustainability
        is exemplified by my final year project, which centers on the design and performance evaluation of Decentralized Wastewater 
        Treatment Systems (<strong>DEWATS</strong>) for sustainable fecal sludge treatment. This project not only underscores my technical expertise but also 
        reflects my dedication to addressing pressing environmental issues through practical and impactful solutions.
        <br><br><br>
        My Final Year Project (FYP) titled <strong><em>"Design and Performance Evaluation of DEWATS for Sustainable Fecal Sludge Treatment"</em></strong> aims 
        to tackle the critical issue of fecal sludge management in a sustainable manner. Fecal sludge poses significant environmental 
        and public health risks, particularly in densely populated urban areas. Through this project, I am designing and evaluating 
        Decentralized Wastewater Treatment Systems (<strong>DEWATS</strong>) as an alternative solution for fecal sludge treatment. DEWATS offer a 
        decentralized approach that can effectively treat fecal sludge at the source, minimizing environmental pollution and
        public health hazards. The project involves rigorous design considerations, performance evaluations, and techno-economic 
        assessments to ensure the effectiveness and viability of the proposed solution. By addressing this pressing environmental challenge,
        the project aims to contribute to the broader goal of sustainable development and environmental stewardship.</p>
