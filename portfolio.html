        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
        <p>Complementing my academic endeavors, I have gained valuable professional experience through internships and industry engagements. 
            During my internship at <strong>Servis Industries Limited</strong> in the Health, Safety, and Environment <strong>(HSE)</strong> department, I gained firsthand 
            experience in implementing environmental health and safety protocols in industrial settings. I actively contributed to initiatives 
            aimed at reducing environmental impact, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting occupational health and safety practices. 
            This experience provided me with invaluable insights into real-world environmental challenges and reinforced my commitment to 
            making a positive impact through engineering solutions.</p>

        <h1>Academic Excellence</h1>
        <p> My journey as an Environmental Engineer began at NUST University, where I immersed myself in a rigorous curriculum that 
            provided me with a solid foundation in environmental sciences, engineering principles, and sustainable practices. 
            Throughout my academic tenure, I excelled in courses related to water treatment, pollution control, environmental management,
            and sustainable development. My commitment to academic excellence is reflected in my consistently high grades and active 
            participation in research projects and extracurricular activities aimed at addressing environmental issues.</p>

        <h1>Expertise in Sustainability and Water Treatment</h1>
        <p> My passion for sustainability and water treatment extends beyond the classroom. I have a deep understanding of sustainable 
            practices and their integration into engineering solutions. From wastewater treatment to sustainable urban planning, I 
            am well-versed in strategies that promote environmental stewardship and resource conservation. My expertise in water 
            treatment encompasses various technologies and methodologies, including but not limited to membrane filtration, biological 
            treatment, and advanced oxidation processes. I am committed to leveraging this knowledge to develop sustainable solutions that 
            address the world's growing water challenges.</p>

        <h1>Software Proficiency</h1>
        <p>In addition to my academic achievements, I have acquired proficiency in a range of software tools essential for environmental 
            engineering and project management. I am adept at AutoCAD, MS CAD, and GPS software, enabling me to create detailed engineering 
            drawings and perform accurate spatial analysis. My proficiency in EPA-NET allows me to model and simulate water distribution systems, 
            optimizing their performance and efficiency. Furthermore, my experience with ArcMap enhances my capabilities in geographic information 
            systems (GIS), facilitating spatial data analysis and visualization for environmental planning and management projects.</p>
