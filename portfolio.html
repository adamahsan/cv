        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
        <p>Complementing my academic endeavors, I have gained valuable professional experience through internships and industry engagements. 
            During my internship at <strong>Servis Industries Limited</strong> in the Health, Safety, and Environment <strong>(HSE)</strong> department, I gained firsthand 
            experience in implementing environmental health and safety protocols in industrial settings. I actively contributed to initiatives 
            aimed at reducing environmental impact, ensuring regulatory compliance, and promoting occupational health and safety practices. 
            This experience provided me with invaluable insights into real-world environmental challenges and reinforced my commitment to 
            making a positive impact through engineering solutions.</p>
        <br>
        <p>At the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources <strong>(PCRWR)</strong>, I honed my skills in the delicate art of not spilling water samples (mostly successful).
             My days were filled with testing water quality, analyzing data, and mastering the ancient ritual of “waiting-for-equipment-to-work.” I also contributed 
             to critical research projects and learned that water is not just H2O; it's a mysterious concoction that demands serious scientific scrutiny.
            I developed a love-hate relationship with lab coats, discovered that “fieldwork” often involves mud, and became an expert at dodging questions 
            about when the results would be ready. Overall, it was a refreshing experience—pun fully intended</p>      
            <br>
        <p>Recently, I was an intern at <strong>BlueDiamond AI</strong>, I dove headfirst into the world of dataset creation, curating data like a DJ at a tech rave. While I can't spill all the secrets
             (thanks to a very official-looking NDA), I can say it involved some groundbreaking work on Unreal Engine 5 — think epic landscapes, next-level 
             simulations, and lots of coffee-fueled creativity. I became a data wrangler, a digital explorer, and a fan of all things unreal (pun intended), 
             pushing the boundaries of what AI can do!</p>

        <h1>Academic Excellence</h1>
        <p> Throughout my time at NUST University, I mastered the fine art of balancing environmental engineering equations with late-night caffeine consumption. 
            I tackled sustainability challenges like they were plot twists in a thriller and even made friends with a few water treatment models along the way. 
            My crowning achievement? Designing a decentralized wastewater treatment system that didn’t just win over my professors, but also left me wondering 
            if I could apply it to my hostel laundry. My academic journey wasn't just about grades; it was about proving that passion, a bit of coffee, 
            and a lot of curiosity can solve just about any environmental puzzle!</p>

        <h1>Expertise in Sustainability and Water Treatment</h1>
        <p> My passion for sustainability and water treatment extends beyond the classroom. I have a deep understanding of sustainable 
            practices and their integration into engineering solutions. From wastewater treatment to sustainable urban planning, I 
            am well-versed in strategies that promote environmental stewardship and resource conservation. My expertise in water 
            treatment encompasses various technologies and methodologies, including but not limited to membrane filtration, biological 
            treatment, and advanced oxidation processes. I am committed to leveraging this knowledge to develop sustainable solutions that 
            address the world's growing water challenges.</p>

        <h1>Software Proficiency</h1>
        <p>Beyond acing my courses, I've become a bit of a software superhero in the realm of environmental engineering. I'm well-versed in AutoCAD and MS CAD, 
            so I can whip up engineering drawings faster than you can say "blueprint." My GPS skills are top-notch, making me a master of spatial analysis 
            (I even found my way out of the library once!). EPA-NET? I've got it covered, optimizing water distribution systems like a pro. And with ArcMap in my 
            toolkit, I can make spatial data look as stunning as a high-def movie, perfect for any environmental planning project. Essentially, 
            if there's a software tool that could save the planet, I've probably used it!</p>
